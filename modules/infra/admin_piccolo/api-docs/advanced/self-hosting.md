::: warning

Fates List is rather annoying (without knowledge in python/golang/rust) to self host. It requires Fedora (support for Windows will never be happening since we do not use it. MacOS support is upcoming). It also needs a large amount of moving parts including PostgreSQL 14 (older versions *may* work but will never be tested) and Redis. In short: **This page is only meant for people who wish to contribute to Fates List. These docs may be out of date. We are working on it**

## Domain Setup

1. Buy a domain (You will need a domain that can be added to Cloudflare in order to use Fates List. We use namecheap for this)

2. Add the domain to Cloudflare (see [this](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Creating-a-Cloudflare-account-and-adding-a-website)). Our whole website requires Cloudflare as the DNS in order to work.

3. Buy a Linux VPS (You need a Linux VPS or a Linux home server with a public ip with port 443 open)

4. In Cloudflare, create a record (A/CNAME) called @ that points to your VPS ip/hostname

5. In Cloudflare, go to Speed > Optimization. Enable AMP Real URL

6. In Cloudflare, go to SSL/TLS, set the mode to Full (strict), enable Authenticated Origin Pull, make an origin certificate (in Origin Server) and save the private key as /key.pem on your VPS and the certificate as /cert.pem on your VPS

7. Download [https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/360044928032/origin-pull-ca.pem](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/360044928032/origin-pull-ca.pem) and save it on the VPS as /origin-pull-ca.pem.

## VPS Setup

1. Download the Fates List repo on the VPS using `git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/FatesList`. Make sure the location it is downloaded to is publicly accessible AKA not in a /root folder or anything like that. Make sure you have `xkcdpass, python3.10, *nightly* rust, go 1.18 or newer and docker-compose, gcc-c++, libffi-devel, libxslt-devel, libxml2-devel, libpq-devel` packages are installed.

3. Run `tmux new -s flamepaw-pinger`. Then enter the ``modules/infra/flamepaw`` folder and run `make && make install`. This will build flamepaw for your system.

4. Enter ``FatesList/config/data`` folder and fill in the required information on the JSON files there. 

5. If you have a database backup, copy it to ``/backups/latest.bak`` where ``/`` is the root of your hard disk, then run `flamepaw --cmd db.setup`. Setup venv using `snowtuft venv setup` (you may need to run this multiple times to install all development dependencies

6. Copy the nginx conf in info/nginx to /etc/nginx

7. Restart nginx

### Starting actual site 

- Do all steps below apart from ``make`` and ``git`` commands on server reboot/full site restart/``tmux`` server kill as well

8. (optional) Run ``python3 pinger.py`` in ``flamepaw-pinger`` tmux session in the ``FatesList/modules/infra/flamepaw-pinger`` folder to start ``flamepaw-pinger`` which will then start ``flamepaw``

9. Enter a tmux session called ``baypaw``. Download baypaw using ``git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/baypaw``, enter the folder, run ``make`` and then run ``target/release/baypaw`` to start baypaw which is a microservice for global API requests across Fates List services.

10. Enter a tmux session called ``next-api``. Download api-v3 using ``git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/api-v3``, enter the folder, run ``make`` and then run ``target/release-lto/fates`` to start api v3.

11. Enter a tmux session called ``squirrelflight``. Download api-v3 using ``git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/squirrelflight``, enter the folder, run ``make`` and then run ``target/release-lto/squirrelflight`` to start squirrelflight.

12. Enter a tmux session called ``widgets``. Run widget API by running ``flamepaw --cmd site.run``.

13. (optional, not done on Fates due to issues) Follow [this](https://stevescargall.com/2020/05/13/how-to-install-prometheus-and-grafana-on-fedora-server/) to set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. Set Grafanas port to 5050. Use a firewall or the digital ocean firewall to block other ports. Do not open prometheus's port in the firewall, only open Grafana's.
