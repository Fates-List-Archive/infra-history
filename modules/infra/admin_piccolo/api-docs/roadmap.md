## Votes (Item 1, tied to item 2)

Votes should have ways to stop complete automation. Possibly with addition of coins though

## Coins (Item 2)

Basic Information

Currency will be usable to:

1. Buy priority spots on the list (this will be hard coded in the code for now)
2. Priority approval of bots*

### How to earn it

- Server boosts
- awarded by staff for server activity
- adding or editing your bot (editing your bot too much for just getting currency may lead to a ban from currency system, adding will give more currency than edits)
- Keeping a good bot page
- Events
- sellix shop (purchasing coins)

*Feel free to request large amount of fates currency for priority reviewing a bot or for bot developers requesting a specific reviewer etc*

## Some Ideas

- Each vote would give small number of coins to owner
- Votes will cost coins
- Coins will replenish/give you enough for one vote every eight hours
- Bronze User will be removed
- Being active in chat = More coins
- Many actions regarding coins (votes) will have cooldown to avoid people spamming
- Sellix webhook (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
