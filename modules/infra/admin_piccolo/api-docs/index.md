# Fates List API

Fates List has two documentations, the main API docs \(here\) and the widget API documentation \(See [Endpoints](api-v3)\) and [Widget API](https://widgets.fateslist.xyz/docs/redoc).

The main API docs here go through webhooks, websockets, CSS and basic structures  while the endpoint documentation is the ”proper” API documentation and it goes through the API endpoints and what they return and it is automatically generated by our framework FastAPI.

We hope you enjoy using the Fates List API just as we enjoyed making it for you!
