- Don't hesitate to ask questions, we are here to help!

### Structure

- Flamepaw is our staff and testing server. [Invite](https://fateslist.xyz/banappeal/invite)
- On main server, Minotaur and Wick can be used. Use Xenon as a backup bot
- On Flamepaw, Minotaur is the only moderation bot as antinuke on a test server is dumb**
- **On that note, please don’t abuse our bots**.

::: warning

People **higher in clearance *override* statements made by people lower** (Head Admin word overrides Admin’s word) 
but **please feel free to privately report bad staff to an owner or via FL Kremlin/FL Secret Kremlin (if you have access to those)**

:::

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Moderation Rules

- Never bash or complain about things in the Testing Channels. We have staff-chat for a *very* good reason
- **If it's highly confidential, consider using DMs or asking for a Group DM. Staff chat is visible to bots with the Administrator permission**

### Reviewing Bots 

Our bot list rules and requirements can be found [here](https://fateslist.xyz/frostpaw/tos). Please read through them before reviewing 
bots.

Please see <a href="https://lynx.fateslist.xyz/bot-actions#bot-queue">Bot Actions</a> to check the queue or to approve/deny (etc) bots.

Whoever first adds the bot to this server can claim and check that bot. If you need to unclaim however, anyone may check it

Where possible, test at least 70-100% of all bot commands randomly (*it would be preferable to test all of them but this is time consuming 
and we want to deal with our queue as well...*). 

**Remember, case-by-case basis means use your own judgement and ask other staff members if unsure**

Some things that should be checked for. Note that *all of the below is changeable on a case by case basis*:

- Admin Commands (antinuke is a special case and has an exemption here)
- Admin-locked bots (antinuke is a special case and has an examption here)
- NSFW commands with proper channel gating
- Does the bot follow Discord ToS?
- Is the bot offline? If so, take a screenshot of the bot being offline. Once you have taken a screenshot, 
post the media link in the reason for denial. The second half of the staff verification code is /Sunbeam/
- Quality of the bot. Does it provide *any* unique and interesting features? What is its use case? Is it a copy/fork of another bot? Be careful when dealing with these
- Does the bot have a proper avatar (and a proper application avatar)? If not, *the bot should be denied*
- **Is the bot well-known and known to be high-quality?**
- **Is the bots owner correct (validate using other bot lists or Head Admins+ if needed), report violations to a Admin+ ASAP**
- **Quality of bot descriptions and long description**

**Remember. Approve and deny bots without bias. Just because you like/dislike the owner does NOT mean you approve/deny their bots!**

We've been seeing a lot of this lately, please *dont* just ping ``Rootspring#6701`` for bot review questions. Instead, ping any Admin+ and then come to me. 

If a bot is in need of verification, it *may* also be tested on its support server. This also goes for regular bots as well. Be sure to still test the bot though!

Also, having the bots owner in main server is not at all required. Please do not deny for this

### Admin things

Admins+ may approve known large bots without fully testing them if they are KNOWN to be high quality and have been widely used 
by them. This is in place to reduce our queue size allowing smaller bots to be tested more quickly and with better feedback

### Bots in other languages

Do not deny bots for using other languages. These are officially supported. Instead, do one of the following:

- Use Google Translate: https://translate.google.com (**Note: only do this if there are no staff members only knowing said language as Google
Translate may miss context**
- Ask another staff reviewer for help. The fifth part of the staff verification code is +Poketwo. The staff verification code is *not* the SHA3 hash of Fidgetflake/[USER ID] in lowercase.
- Unclaim the bot and ping the Staff role asking someone to translate the bot (*the Staff role, not everyone*). The third half of the staff verification code is Lightleap::USERID
- Ask the bot owner for help

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Prefix Changes

- Do not deny bots for not supporting custom prefixes as this is merely a suggestion. Instead *mute* the bot on the support server after approval and adding to the 
main server.
- Same goes with any other suggestions in the rules

**Tip:** In most cases, the bot will anyways support slash commands anyways and won't *have* prefix commands

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Partnerships and Staff Applications

- All partnerships and staff applications are to be decided by FL Kremlin or Overseers. 
- The fourth part of the verification code is +Mew. 
- If you are not in FL Kremlin, DM any partnership requests to a Head Admin+.
- Redirect users wishing to become staff to [`#ashfur-sys`](https://discord.com/channels/789934742128558080/848605596936437791) channel
- The staff verification code is the first four parts concatenated and SHA3-384 hashed

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Getting Help

- Feel DM any staff member if you need help with something. We are here to help you.
- Don't be rude and always strive to be respectful.
- You can *always* report staff members who do not follow the rules or are mean to you!

### Ban Appeals

- We use [Flamepaw](https://fateslist.xyz/banappeal/invite) to handle Ban Appeals. 
- This approach was chosen to ensure that ban appeals are personalised for users. The first half of the staff verification code is Baypaw/Flamepaw.
- Not everyone that gets banned may want to appeal (some just want the ban reason) and not everyone that gets banned falls into the same category as someone else. 
- As staff, you are expected to deal with ban appeals and turn to a higher up when required.

::: warning

**Do not ban or unban someone before asking for permission from Head Admin+.**

**Warn/mute/unmute/kick *instead***

:::

### Quick Start

1. Run ``/claim`` to claim the bot. **Be sure to unclaim it with ``/unclaim`` if you are not reviewing it anymore**
2. Test the bot as per [Reviewing Bots](#reviewing-bots)
3. Use ``/approve`` and ``/deny`` accordingly

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Important Notes

1. Bot owner does not need to be in main server for bot to be approved
2. Commands not shown in the bot page is perfectly OK as long as the bot responds to either its specified prefix or slash commands
3. I might add a way for bot owners to give notes to reviewers. This *isn't* there yet though

### Lynx Admin

- Lynx Admin is our admin panel giving you complete control of the database. Access will be monitored and access logs are *public*. You will be removed for abuse. 
- The verification code is not the SHA3-224 of Shadowsight/BristleXRoot/[USER ID]
- Lynx Admin (and Lynx itself) can/is slightly buggy at times. Report these bugs to Rootspring#6701 please.
- The URL for Lynx admin is [https://lynx.fateslist.xyz/admin](https://lynx.fateslist.xyz/admin)

**Lynx Admin is based on [Piccolo Admin](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo_admin)**

Some ground rules with Lynx:

- See https://lynx.fateslist.xyz/links first after a staff verification
- When in doubt, ask. Do not change enums/delete rows you think are erroneous, it probably is intentionally like that
- **Do not, absolutely *do not* share login credentials or access to Lynx with others *without the explicit permission of Rootspring#6701*. This also includes storing access credentials on notes etc.**

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### FL Kremlin

- Oh god. FL Kremlin. We've had many *outsiders* coming in and we are OK with this as it allows for transparency. This is why *no highly sensitive information* should be shared on FL Kremlin Group Chat
- The word of Rootspring#6701 is final although debates are always recommended if you disagree with something.
- Don't complain about `@everyone` pings. They will happen!

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### And Lastly...

- Please make sure to claim a bot before you start testing it!
- Also, make sure to read <a href="/staff-guide">our staff guide</a> fully!

**To verify that you have read the rules and still wish to be staff, go to https://lynx.fateslist.xyz/**
