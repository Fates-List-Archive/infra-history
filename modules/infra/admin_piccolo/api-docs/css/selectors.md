**Key**

TYPE() means that there are many TYPEs as subchildren of this object and TYPE[] means that there are multiple of these TYPES retrieved as an array and not as subchildren when you use document.querySelectorAll on it. TYPE{} means both and is equivalent to TYPE()[]. Anything in bold is a variable and you should see the description for information about it.
