**How to deploy**

1. Buy a domain (You will need a domain that can be added to Cloudflare in order to use Fates List. We use namecheap for this)

2. Add the domain to Cloudflare (see [this](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Creating-a-Cloudflare-account-and-adding-a-website)). Our whole website requires Cloudflare as the DNS in order to work.

3. Buy a Linux VPS (You need a Linux VPS or a Linux home server with a public ip with port 443 open)

 4a) In Cloudflare, create a record (A/CNAME) called @ that points to your VPS ip/hostname

 4b) In Cloudflare, go to Speed > Optimization. Enable AMP Real URL
 
 4c) In Cloudflare, go to SSL/TLS, set the mode to Full (strict), enable Authenticated Origin Pull, make an origin certificate (in Origin Server) and save the private key as /key.pem on your VPS and the certificate as /cert.pem on your VPS
 
 4d) Download https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/360044928032/origin-pull-ca.pem and save it on the VPS as /origin-pull-ca.pem.

5. Download this repo on the VPS using "git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/FatesList"

6. Enter Fates List directory, copy config_template.py to config.py and fill in the required information on there. You do not need to change site_url or mobile_site_url fields (site and mobile_site do need to be filled in without the https://).

7. Download and install nginx, redis, python3 and PostgreSQL (using the pg_user and pg_pwd you setup in config.py)

8. Remove the /etc/nginx folder, then copy the nginx folder from this repo to /etc. Change the server_name values /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf to reflect your domain

9. Restart nginx

10. Install tmux, then run "tmux"

11. Run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

12. Run "./run" in the repo folder
