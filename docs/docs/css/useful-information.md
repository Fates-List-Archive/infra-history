# Useful Information

In addition to the CSS reference here, Fates List also uses djibe material as a framework ([https://djibe.github.io/material/](https://djibe.github.io/material/)) As such you can use anything from djibe material in your CSS or your long description without needing to load the library.

Do not load in custom css frameworks as this will break your bots long description.

#### Some Useful Classes
