# API Pinning

When using the Fates List API, be sure to pin the api version. The /api will always point to latest API version thanks to our versioning middleware and this version may change often . To avoid breaking changes, just pin the version you are using. Note that the endpoint docs use the Direct Pinning, while you typically want and we recommend Header Pinning  


**Header Pinning**

The first way to pin the version is by using the ’FL-API-Version’ header. Just set this header to the API version you are using \(just the number, not the v part\).

**Direct Pinning**

Another very common way to pin the API versiom is to directly access the needed version using /api/vVERSION/endpoint like in the endpoint docs instead of /api. This is the most common form of pinning. This does not apply to documentation

**Middleware Information \(for those curious\)**

The /api route actually handled by a ASGI middleware which sees the API request, checks for version pinning and whether it’s a API request or a docs request and then edits the ASGI scope \(I know, this is hacky but the easiest and probably the only way\) accordingly to handle the API with the default API version internally pinned if not explicitly overrided otherwise. This default version pin is what allows you to use the API without pinning.
