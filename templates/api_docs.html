		<strong>There are many types of webhooks in Fates List. Please choose the one you use carefully</strong><br/><br/>
		<strong>All Fates List webhooks (excl. Discord Integration) will have a Authorization header with your API Token so you can validate the request.</strong>
	</div>
<div style="font-size: 18px;" class="docm">
<strong style="font-size: 20px;" class="doc">Vote Webhook</strong><span>Your vote webhook will be sent in this format:</span>
<div class="table">

  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>

	add_bot - Unusable as you don't have the api token, but is there to be complete<br/><br/>
	Context:<br/>None
	<br/><br/><br/>
	edit_bot - This will be sent when you or someone else edits your bot.<br/><br/>
	Context:<br/>user - The user id (in string) who has editted your bot
	<br/><br/><br/>
        delete_bot - This will be sent when you or someone else deletes your bot.<br/><br/>
        Context:<br/>user - The user id (in string) who has editted your bot
        <br/><br/><br/>
	view - This will be sent whenever someone views your bot. <strong>It is only sent in websockets as a WsEvent (which is an extension of an Event)</strong><br/><br/>
	Context:<br/>user - The user id (in string) who is viewing your bot<br/>widget - Whether the user is viewing it as a widget or not. Due to our WebSocket and Redis implementation, you will get a string "True" or "False"
    </td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>context</td>
    <td>This is the event context. See the event key for the full list of arguments (key value pairs) you will get for each events</td>
    <td>Dictionary (JSON)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bot_id</td>
    <td>This is the bot ID of the bot who is recieving the event. This will be a snowflake</td>
    <td>Snowflake</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>For your reference, here is an example of a Event. This is also the base of the websocket WsEvent so make you understand this: {'event': 'edit_bot', 'context': {'user': '563808552288780322'}, 'bot_id': '798951566634778641'}</p>

<h3><strong>WebSocket Documentation</strong></h3>
<div style="font-size: 18px;" class="docm">
<p>Fates List offers a WebSocket API at /api/ws for getting real time stats on your bot. This is the only way to get view events (and potentially other events). All things sent must be as payloads, which are JSONs with a special format. See below for more information</p>
<p>Upon attempting to connect to /api/ws, you must communicate using payloads. After authentication, the transmissions become one way from server to your client. The below table explains the payload format:</p>
<div class="table">
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Type</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>payload</td>
    <td>This is a payload which is essentially what is being sent to you. This can be a IDENTITY, STATUS, KILL_CONN or EVENTS but this may change in the future</td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>This is the payload type which is how you are supposed to respond or extra information about the payload such as NO_AUTH or API_TOKEN.</td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>If the payload is a data payload like EVENTS_V1, then this the main data sent by the payload. This key is not present on non-data payloads</td>
    <td>Optional[String]</td>
  </tr>

</table>
</div>
<strong class="doc">Identity Payload</strong><span>{"payload": "IDENTITY", "type": "API_TOKEN"}</span>
<p>Identity Payloads are what you will get when you first try to connect to the WebSocket API. You must repond using a IDENTITY_RESPONSE payload with the type being API_TOKEN and the data being the <em>list</em> of API Tokens you want events for. If you do not use the correct format, a KILL_CONN payload with the type INVALID_IDENTITY_RESPONSE will be sent to you and the connection will be closed with code 4004. If none of your API Tokens match, you will get a KILL_CONN payload with the type NO_AUTH. Once connections is successful, a STATUS payload with type READY and data being all registered bot IDs according to the API Token's you have sent will be sent to you. From here, all transmissions other than ping become server -> client only with no further interaction other than ping required.<br/><br/>For your reference, here is an example of a IDENTITY_RESPONSE: {"payload": "IDENTITY_RESPONSE", "type": "API_TOKEN", "data": ["TOKEN1", "TOKEN2"]}
</p>
<strong class="doc">Events Payload</strong><span>{"payload": "EVENTS", "type": "EVENTS_V1", "data": {"bot_id": WsEventsObject, "bot_id_2": WsEventsObject}</span>
<p>Events Payloads are what you will get after connecting to the websocket whenever you have a new event. You will see that you will get a nested JSON with the bot id as key and a WsEventsObject as value (from above, see example for clarification) which will have its keys as the event id's (views get a random id) and the value being a WsEvent (see below for what this contains)<br/><br/>The type of the Events Payload may be changed if breaking changes are made. A WsEvent similar to a Fates Client Webhook with the below format. The events you will get here are exactly what you will get via Fates Client Webhook so see that for context and everything else:</p>
<div class="table">
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Type</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>payload</td>
    <td>This is a payload of the event which is essentially what is being sent to you. This will always be 'event' in a WsEvent</td>
    <td>String['event']</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>event</td>
    <td>This is the type of WebSocket event you are getting</td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>context</td>
    <td>This is the context of the event</td>
    <td>Dictionary (JSON)</td>
  </tr>

</table>
</div>
<p>For your reference, here is an example of a EVENTS payload: {"payload": "EVENTS", "type": "EVENTS_V1", "data": {"631115725876101150": {"18741a69-552b-4d7d-ab0b-7ed211a22049": {"payload": "event", "event": "view", "context": {"user": 0, "hidden": 1, "widget": "False"}}}}}
